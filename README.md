This site is an SPA where the client can know, edit and create videogames. The information was
consumed from an API provided by Henry.

So that you can have the repository on your computer locally you must clone it. Then in the root
folder you have two folders client and api, in both you have to run the npm install command.
Then in the api folder, you must create an .env file with this content: DB_USER = "Your DB user"
DB_PASSWORD = "Your DB password"
DB_HOST = "Your database host"
DB_NAME = "The name of the database"
PORT = "The port database"
After running the npm start command, the app will open in the browser.
